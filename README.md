The intention of this Discord bot is to automate the monotonous process of manually uploading and posting logs after every raid or fractal clear. At the call of a single command, your most recent logs will be uploaded to both [dps.report](https://dps.report/) and [GW2Raidar](https://gw2raidar.com/info-help), and all of the links will be posted in your Discord server within minutes.
